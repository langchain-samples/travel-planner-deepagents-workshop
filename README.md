# Deep Agents Travel Planner Workshop

A hands-on, single-notebook walkthrough that builds a production-style travel planner agent from scratch using [Deep Agents](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/deepagents/overview) on top of LangChain and LangGraph, then evaluates it with LangSmith.

The notebook lives at `notebooks/deepagents-travel-planner.ipynb` and is designed to be worked through top-to-bottom in a guided session with a LangChain engineer.

## What You'll Build

By the end of the notebook you'll have a travel planning agent that can:

- Plan a multi-day trip from a single user request
- Delegate research to specialized subagents (`hotel-search`, `flight-search`, `activity-search`) running in parallel
- Read and write files on a virtual filesystem via `read_file` / `write_file` / `edit_file`
- Pause for human approval before "booking" anything
- Remember a traveler's preferences across conversations (per-user, with a shared global namespace)
- Follow a team-authored `AGENTS.md` and load on-demand `SKILL.md` files for each deliverable (itinerary, budget, packing list, travel brief)
- Emit a final itinerary and budget in your team's exact format

You'll also build a small LangSmith evaluation suite that runs the same dataset against two OpenAI models (`gpt-5.4` and `gpt-4.1-mini`), with four metrics — trajectory match, constraint check, efficiency, and LLM-as-judge response quality — so you can compare cost / latency / quality side-by-side in the LangSmith experiment comparison view.

## Notebook Outline

The notebook is split into eleven parts. Each part introduces one concept and adds one capability:

| Part | Topic | What's introduced |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Setup & Installation | `uv sync` or `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `.env`, model config |
| 1 | Your First Deep Agent | `create_deep_agent`, the harness, planner + virtual filesystem out of the box |
| 2 | Adding Custom Tools | Deterministic offline stubs for discovery (`search_travel`) and pricing/availability |
| 3 | Understanding Backends | `StateBackend` (per-thread default), preview of `StoreBackend` for cross-thread persistence |
| 4 | Adding Subagents | `hotel-search`, `flight-search`, `activity-search` + an orchestrator that fans out via `task()` |
| 5 | Middleware Deep Dive | Built-in `TodoListMiddleware`, writing a custom `@wrap_tool_call` logger |
| 6 | Human-in-the-Loop | `HumanInTheLoopMiddleware`, interrupts, `Command(resume=...)` |
| 7 | Long-Term Memory | `CompositeBackend` routing `/memories/user/` and `/memories/shared/` to a `StoreBackend` with per-user namespaces |
| 8 | `AGENTS.md` & Skills | Identity file + on-demand `SKILL.md` files for each deliverable |
| 9 | The Complete Travel Planner | All layers composed end-to-end |
| 10 | Evaluations | LangSmith dataset, four evaluators (trajectory, constraint, efficiency, LLM-judge), two-model comparison |
| 11 | Next Steps | Where to take the agent next (real APIs, calendar, multi-leg trips, group travel) |

Each part is independently runnable — you can stop at any layer and have a working agent for that scope.

## Pre-work

### Clone the repo
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd travel-planner-deepagents-workshop
```

### Configure environment variables
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in: OPENAI_API_KEY (or your provider's keys) + LANGSMITH_API_KEY for Part 10 evals
```

No Tavily key needed — discovery is handled by a deterministic offline stub so the workshop runs without external APIs.

If corporate policy blocks API keys, contact your LangChain representative and we'll find a workaround.

### Install dependencies

Two options — both install the exact same pinned versions (`requirements.txt` is generated from `uv.lock` and is pip-tested on Python 3.11).

**Option A: `uv`** (recommended if you have it)
```bash
pip install uv
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**Option B: `pip`**
```bash
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Versions are pinned to a known-good combo (`deepagents==0.5.2`, `langgraph==1.1.6`, `langchain-core==1.2.28`) to avoid the `ToolRuntime.__init__() missing 'tools'` skew that newer `langgraph` releases trigger with `deepagents` 0.5.x.

## Running

### As a notebook

Open `notebooks/deepagents-travel-planner.ipynb` in JupyterLab, VS Code, or Cursor and select the workshop's `.venv` as the kernel.

If your editor doesn't auto-detect the venv, register it as a named Jupyter kernel:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m ipykernel install --user --name=travel-planner --display-name="Travel Planner"
```

Then pick **Travel Planner** from the kernel selector.

### As a LangGraph Studio agent

The agent in `agents/travel_planner/` is registered in `langgraph.json`. Launch it locally with:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
langgraph dev
```

This starts an API server at `http://localhost:2024` and prints a LangGraph Studio URL. Studio gives you a visual graph view, message-level tracing, checkpoint history, and a chat panel.

## Model Configuration

Model selection is centralized in `utils/models.py`. The default is OpenAI (`openai:gpt-5.4`). To use a different provider, edit `.env` only — `utils/models.py` auto-detects Azure OpenAI when `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` is set. AWS Bedrock and Google Vertex AI examples are kept as commented blocks in `utils/models.py` for reference.

The notebook's Part 10 evaluations call `get_model()` (from `utils/models.py`), so the eval section automatically inherits the active provider — no code edits needed.

### Azure OpenAI / APIM gateway (Azure URL shape)

Setting `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` in `.env` auto-switches `utils/models.py` to `AzureChatOpenAI`. No code changes required. Required vars:

```
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-key>
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=<your-endpoint>
AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=2025-03-01-preview
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT=<deployment-name>
```

Note: Part 10's two-model comparison targets the same Azure deployment in this mode — LangSmith renders two distinct experiments (different `experiment_prefix` labels), but the underlying compute is identical. For true cross-model comparison, use standard OpenAI credentials.

### AWS Bedrock
```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
AWS_REGION_NAME=us-east-1
AWS_MODEL_ARN=...
```

### Google Vertex AI
```
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=./vertexCred.json
```
Make sure `vertexCred.json` is in `.gitignore`.
